Hi! I am Coen, a student from the `Delft University of Technology`, currently working on my Master's thesis in `GÃ¶teborg, Sweden`.
My focus is on 'Embedded Systems' and now I am diving into the world of `wireless sensor networks`.

In the coming weeks I will post some things I found during my research and some tutorials on setting up stuff.

Contact me on `coen@student.chalmers.se`!
